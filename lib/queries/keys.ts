/**
 * Every TanStack Query key in the app comes from here — no inline arrays.
 *
 * Two rules the shape encodes:
 *
 * 1. Per-user data lives under `["me", userId, …]`. The user id in the key means
 *    a different account can never be served another's cached rows, and the
 *    shared `["me"]` root lets AuthProvider drop all of it in one call on
 *    sign-out or an account switch.
 *
 * 2. Inputs are normalised before they reach a key (ids sorted, text trimmed
 *    and lower-cased, map bounds rounded) so equivalent requests share one
 *    cache entry instead of fragmenting it.
